# 🧠 C Interpreter

A lightweight interpreter for a subset of the C programming language, built for educational and experimental purposes. This project parses and executes C-like syntax, supporting variables, arithmetic, conditionals, and functions.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧮 Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- 📦 Variable declarations and assignments
- 🔁 Conditionals and control flow (`if`, `while`, `else`)
- 🧰 Function definitions and calls
- 🐞 Basic error handling and debugging output
- 📄 Optional REPL or script execution mode
- Maybe some OOP (We'll see..)
